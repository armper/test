## Everyday Alert Management
- As a subscriber, I want to acknowledge or temporarily mute individual NOAA alerts so I can focus on the situations that still matter to me.
- As a subscriber, I want to see a timeline of recent alerts I received so I can confirm that my notifications are working as expected.
- As a subscriber, I want clear confirmations when I create, update, or delete custom alerts so I know my preferences were saved.

## Location Confidence
- As a subscriber, I want my saved areas to appear visually on maps when setting up alerts so I can double-check I am watching the right place.
- As a subscriber, I want to drop a pin or select a saved area on a map when creating alerts so I can avoid typing coordinates.

## Operational Trust
- As an operator, I want to understand which alerts users silence or acknowledge so I can improve default alert filters.
