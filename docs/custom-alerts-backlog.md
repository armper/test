# Custom Alerts Backlog

- ~~As a platform engineer, I want to evaluate custom condition alerts with bounded concurrency so I can keep scheduler runtimes low as we scale.~~
- ~~As a database administrator, I want the evaluator to load only alerts that are due for evaluation so I can reduce database load at high tenant counts.~~
- ~~As an operations lead, I want the NOAA client to retry with exponential backoff on rate limits so I can maintain reliable alerting during traffic spikes.~~
- ~~As a platform architect, I want to reuse hourly forecasts for nearby locations so I can minimize duplicate NOAA calls across customers.~~
- ~~As an observability engineer, I want tenant-scoped evaluation metrics exported so I can track SLA health across the SaaS footprint.~~
